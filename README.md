Repo Organization:
Currently, our repo was mixed up a bit as we, due to still figuring out quirks of github, merged all of our branches to our master branch.
However, looking at our repo you will find that we still have our original branches under the branches tab and you may
go here to see our original organization. For the most part our master contained many of our class required project tasks, 
and our separate branches, such as connector/python, held our side work in the connector/python. We also had a dedicated 
branch to our gui, which holds much of Michael's and Nish's work on our phenomenal gui. We also have an e_r diagram and
project requirements branch which is open, yet we have merged these to our master. 
The gem of our repo is found within our four beautiful folder's in our organize branch which are Assignment_Submissions,
doc, src, and test. Each folder is, as you would believe, what it says. Our doc has all our generated sphinx documentation,
our src has all of our source code, and our test has our test code. The cherry on top of our gem is the Assignment_Submissions,
which contains all previous assignments we have completed as required by the class.

CI System:
We are not using a CI System with our project and in fact find it far more gratifying to write and execute our tests
each time by our own free will. Rather than allowing the machines to take control of our baby. CI System, or as some
call it "Skynet."
