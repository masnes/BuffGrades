Title: BuffGrades
Description: We're building a grade tracker which keeps track of assignment types (tests, homework, projects, etc.) and the grade-weight of each one. User's can specify this information when they start a class, and the app will record it. From there, the user will input the grades they receive on these assignment types, and the grade tracker will tell them their current grade, projected grade, and how well they need to do on future assignments to make various grades for the class.
Vision statement: To show students how well they are doing, and how well they need to do to be successful.
Motivation: Everyone in our group manually does some of these calcutions, and would like to use this app.
Risks:
  - Our team members mostly don't know each other well, so we have yet to see if our group will be a good fit.
    - Mitigation: We'll be proactive in getting to know each other, and have weekly teambuilding meetings.
  - Most team members are fairly inexperience with programming, so we will be learning much of what we need to know while building the app. Consequently, we may unknowingly make poor design decisions that create technical debt, and have longstanding effects on the project.
    - Mitigation: We'll proactively spend extra time researching our design decisions before we commit to them.
  - Userbases are fickle, and no one may end up using our app.
    - Mitigation: We'll do what we can to make the app easy to use, and visually attractive.
